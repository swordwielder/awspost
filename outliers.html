  Outliers Summary

  <p>
    <font size="4">
Outliers is a book about success.

In the book Malcolm Gladwell talked about how your birth had predetermined several factors of how your life will play out.
The book covered a story of hockey players in Canada, when they did a survey of the hockey players,
they found out that majority of the players are born in the early of the year i.e. January, February instead of November and December.
The reason for that is because of the people who are born in the same year got put together in the same team,
and those couple of months of being older gets them an advantage over those who are born at the end of the year because of brain and body maturity.

This not only applies to hockey players but also the richest person in the world, Bill Gates.
Gates was born in a good family but he was also being advantaged in a way. He was born at the right time and at the right place.
The reason for that is because at the time that he was born,
computers were not a common thing and yet his library was able to have a computer in which he was able to have access to.
Although his circumstances was advantaged, he also put in a lot of work.
He spent a lot of time on the computer that by the time he was 18, he had already spent 10000 hours on the computer.
The 10000 hour rule by Gladwell says that someone need to spent at least 10000 hours in order to be at a world class level.

Circumstances means so much that someone who is more talented and smarter could have no opportunity to grow.
Christopher Langan, who had around 200 IQ (more than Gates) had no opportunity against someone like Gates who had an advantage because of the place,
time he was born. Even if he put in work, his circumstances had denied him of such an opportunity,
because of the fact that his family was poor, he had to work at an early age to help his family.
People like Gates who are advantaged at birth will continue to stay ahead of others, this is called the cumulative advantage.

As I mentioned earlier, the place and time that you are born are important.
In fact this is so important that it could matter in a life or death situation,
Gladwell mentioned in the book that the Avianca Flight 52 crash could have prevented if from the co-pilot was born in a
different environment where the people he spent time with are more assertive, then the flight wouldn't have crashed.
The reason for that is because you are the average of the 5 people you spent the most time with. Remember to choose wisely on who
you spend the most time with because those people would ultimately affect you in one way or another.
