      The four hour work week short summary

      The headline of the book is, escape the 9-5, live anywhere and join the new rich. Can this be done? Absolutely! But can everyone do it? Absolutely not! Why is that? So here's a question to ponder. Can you become in charge of your response? As in, if you bought something and it doesn't work, can you not get angry and be in control. For most people, this is hard but for some other people it is easier because they can be in charge of their response and emotions.

      To get back on track, imagine this scenario: John makes 30k per year while Steve makes 150k per year. Who's richer? If you're like anyone, of course you'll say Steve is richer. But what if Steve works 80 hours a week and can only live in NYC because that's where his job is while John works 10 hours a week and can live anywhere because he just needs to be in front of a computer?

      This is where it gets interesting! :)

      Turns out Steve makes around 36 dollars an hour while John makes around 58 dollars an hour. Imagine Steve needing to go out and buy stuff, his expenses would be much higher than John who can technically live anywhere where his expenses are much less. It is true that in terms of Absolute income, Steve makes more money but why does it matter when relative income matters more? To give you a better understanding, imagine this scenario: Imagine I offer you a job in a city that pays you 1 million dollars a year. But you got to the city and you found out that a loaf of bread costs 200 thousand dollars, are you really richer? You're not.

      A great idea of this book is negotiation, if you think entrepreneurship is not for you, negotiate with your boss to get the freedom of time and location, of course, you wouldn't want to ask for that straight out of the way. Ask for an inch, then two inches and as it progresses, you will be able to ask for a foot. The point is to get the freedom of time and the freedom of location for work, if you can do that, you're worth more than someone like Steve. Remember if your boss doesn't agree to your terms at all, you're most likely better off else where, check this on how to find another job quickly.

      The basic idea of this book is you create a product and you sell it. Basic entrepreneurship. Remember that there's more ways to make money than just get a job, people get jobs because that's what most people know how to do and it's easy and it works for the average person and that's ok. But if you're unhappy about that, then take these principles. Most people don't know that you can make money online from just stuff like Youtube and Google Adsense. Granted they would need to have some knowledge of SEO, but think about it this way. You spend 1 year to learn all this and take 1 more year to apply it. You're still better off than people who works for 40 years of their lives.

      Now you might say, hey even if I did made a successful business, I'm still doing all the work. Now the book emphasizes a lot about getting Virtual Assistants. Why is this important? Because the VA's can help you do your job. You might say that the job you have doesn't need VA's. The point is to get used to getting virtual assistants so that when the time comes you'll know what to look for in virtual assistants. Check websites like yourmaninindia. This takes care of outsourcing, for elimination of work, use the 80/20 principle. This principle states that 20 percent of a rug gets 80 percent of the wear and tear and 80 percent of the complaints of a company comes from 20 percent of the customers. To eliminate work on websites check out tools such as ahrefs and google analytics.

      In conclusion, this is a great book and this is highly recommended for people who wants to take control of their lives. To get the full book and see what I didn't include in this article, click here.
